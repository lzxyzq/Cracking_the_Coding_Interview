# There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle.What is the probability of collision(between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction,with either direction being equally likely to be chosen,and that they walk at the same speed.
# Similarly,find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon

#Solving:
# Since every ant has two choices (pick either of two edges going through the corner on which ant is initially sitting), there are total 23 possibilities.

# Out of 23 possibilities, only 2 donâ€™t cause collision. So, the probability of collision is 6/8 and the probability of non-collision is 2/8.
