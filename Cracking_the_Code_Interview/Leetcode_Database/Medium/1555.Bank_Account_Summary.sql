Leetcode Bank (LCB) helps its coders in making virtual payments. Our bank records all transactions in the table Transaction, we want to find out the current balance of all users and check wheter they have breached their credit limit (If their current credit is less than 0).

Write an SQL query to report.

user_id
user_name
credit, current balance after performing transactions.  
credit_limit_breached, check credit_limit ("Yes" or "No")
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.
