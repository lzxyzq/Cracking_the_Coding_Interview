Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
 
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |




select 
    round(min(sqrt(power(p1.x-p2.x, 2)+power(p1.y-p2.y, 2))), 2) shortest
from 
    point_2d p1 join point_2d p2 on p1.x<p2.x or (p1.x=p2.x and p1.y<p2.y)
